<p style="font-color:white"><p style="font-family:calibri;">My name is Sahana Radhakrishnan and I am a student studying at Podar International School, Mumbai. I love computers and coding, as well as quizzing, which is why I decided to make quizzing the theme of this website. I also love competitions and have participated in quite a few of them. I have won in the maRRS spelling bee and their math bee. Additionally, I love animals and feed stray dogs and cats whenever I can. Reading books and sketching are also two things I enjoy. Some of my favorite books are Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. I like to experiment with new things, no matter how difficult they are, which is why I used some considerably basic JavaScript in this website, something I had never used before. </p>
